                   Version 2, December 2004

By using this script, you agree to the following terms (or you don’t, who cares?):

DO WHAT THE F*** YOU WANT TO with this script, but please be kind enough to:

    1. Procrastinate wisely.
    2. Drink coffee or tea responsibly while using this.
    3. Remember to breathe during those long deployments.
    4. Give credit where credit is due. But if you forget, no hard feelings.
    5. Summon ‘the_one_whose_name_must_not_be_pronounced’ carefully.

Also:

    - You can copy, distribute, and modify this script, because, why not?
    - No warranties, no promises, just code and caffeine.
    - If something goes wrong... well, it’s not our fault. Seriously, don't call us.
    - If you create something cool with this, send us a GIF or a funny meme. Or not, it’s your call.

                 DO WHAT THE F*** YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION
        (Because you have nothing better to do right now, right?)

     0. You just DO WHAT THE F*** YOU WANT TO.

                END OF TERMS. 
      (Now go ahead, break things... just not in production, please.)
